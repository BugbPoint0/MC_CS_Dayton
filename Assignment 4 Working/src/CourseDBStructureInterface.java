/**
 * This is the interface to the Course Database Structure Class.  It is the data structure
 * class that is used with the Course Database Manager class.
 * This is a hash table with buckets.  Your hash table with be an array of 
 * linked lists of CourseDatabaseElements. Use the hashcode for a 
 * CourseDatabaseElement to find the location in the hash table for the linked lists of  
 * CourseDatabaseElements.
 * 
 * There should be two constructors.  The first one takes in an integer which represents the
 * estimated size of the hash table. 
 * 
 * Since the requirement is for a closed-addressing hash table (bucket hashing), 
 * you will not need to compute a 4k+3 prime.
 * 
 * If you were doing open-addressing, you would determine the size of the table by using a loading
 * factor of 1.5 and a 4K+3 prime.  Example: if you estimated 500 words, 500/1.5 = 333.  
 * The next 4K+3 prime over 333 is 347.  So the tableSize would be 347.
 * 
 * The other constructor will take in a String and an int.  The string will be "Testing"
 * and the int will be the size of the hash table.  This is used only for testing.
